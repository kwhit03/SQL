#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) from BIT_DB.JanSales where Product like "%iphone%"

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers AS c
left outer join BIT_DB.FebSales AS f
ON c.order_id= f.orderID
GROUP BY acctnum

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, 
COUNT(product) AS "#of units sold",
SUM(price) AS "Revenue"
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, 
COUNT(product) AS "#of units sold",
SUM(price) AS "Revenue"
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE "%548 Lincoln%"
GROUP BY Product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(C.acctnum), 
ROUND(AVG(f.Quantity)*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS c
left outer join BIT_DB.FebSales AS f
ON c.order_id= f.orderID
WHERE f.Quantity > 2;
